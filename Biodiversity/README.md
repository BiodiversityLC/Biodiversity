# Biodiversity - What is it?
![](https://trello.com/1/cards/66c2c21123e9b25652597531/attachments/66c2da1736bf78ac2150fc72/download/readmebanner.png) <br> <br>
Biodiversity is a mod that aims to expand Lethal Company's current selection of enemies by adding variants of pre-existing entities and some original stuff along the way. <br> <br> Their goal is to provide unique gameplay interactions  and spice up the already present gameplay loop, along with aiding the player in some cases.

## Currently adds:
- 2 Enemy variants.
- 1 Sub-entity.
- 2 Critter variants (simpler, environmental entities).
- And more coming Soon™.

# Entities
### The Aloe - Bracken Variant

<details>
<summary> Spoilers </summary> 
<br> 
The Aloe is a neutral entity with AI similar to the Bracken's.
<br>

Once a player is caught by an Aloe, they'll be taken away and held captive in her favorite spot, where she'll nurse them back to health.
<br> The way you counter her is the same as the Bracken's, so watch your back!

### Ogopogo - Earth Leviathan Variant

<details>
<summary> Spoilers </summary>
<br>
The Ogopogo are hostile entities with similar behavioral patterns to Earth Leviathans.
<br>

Any player spotted near their general area will be targeted and promptly dragged underwater where its young, the Vermin, will eat away at them.
<br> The only way to effectively counter Ogopogi is to run away as soon as you hear their warning signal or hold onto an active stun device while it's snatching you. </details>

</details>

### Vermin, Prototax and Leaf boys - Critter Variants

<details>
<summary> Spoilers </summary>
<br>
Vermin, Prototax and Leaf boys are some of Biodiversity's more simple entities. <br>

<br/> Vermin are the spawn of the Ogopogo, and come out during floods or after their parent Ogo has dragged prey into their nest. <br/> Try smacking em! <br/> <br/>
Prototax are four legged fungi creatures related (non-biologically) to Spore lizards. Just like spore lizards, they wander around and release spores when threatened. <br/> Their spores are toxic, so leave them be! <br/> <br/>
Leaf boys are small, leaf-like organisms that like to run around and have fun during the early hours of the day. <br> They're quite timorous, so watch yourself around them at night! They might attract unwanted attention.

</details>

## Roadmap - What can I expect from Biodiversity in the future? 
<br>

We have big plans for the future, here's a rough outline of what's to come!
- At least 4 more enemy variants.
- A few more critter variants.
- A few cool items.
- More environmental interactions.
- Unique spawn mechanics.

# Known Issues - Whoops :3 <br>

There are some problems with our entities that we'll look into fixing in the future, like:
- Ogopogo can wander into the ground on certain spots on Vow.
- Ogopogo is NOT supported on moons other than the ones in the default spawn rarity config. If you make him spawn there he'll be in places he's not supposed to be.
- Ogopogo is able to spawn in interiors with water (Mineshaft, Chizra Temple, etc.) except for Liminal Pools. This is an oversight, and we'll work on fixing it for future versions; as a temporary fix, we made Ogopogo invisible for players inside and prevented them from aggroing to anyone who is.
- Vermin are kind of broken at the moment, so we've decided to disable them by default now via me.biodiversity.ogopogo.cfg. They no longer log spam like in previous versions, but they spawn inside the ground and are mostly a non-factor, generally they just take away from night time power level by being there so yeah :P.
