# Biodiversity - What is it?
![](https://trello.com/1/cards/66c2c21123e9b25652597531/attachments/66c2da1736bf78ac2150fc72/download/readmebanner.png) <br> <br>
Biodiversity is a mod that aims to expand Lethal Company's current selection of enemies by adding variants of pre-existing entities and some original stuff along the way. <br> <br> Their goal is to provide unique gameplay interactions  and spice up the already present gameplay loop, along with aiding the player in some cases.

## Currently adds:
- 3 Enemy variants.
- 1 Sub-entities.
- 3 Critter variants (simpler, environmental entities).
- 1 Scrap item with 7 texture variations.
- And more coming Soon™.

# Entities
### [ The Aloe ] - Bracken Variant

<details><summary> Spoilers </summary> <br> The Aloe is a neutral entity with AI similar to the Bracken's.
<br> <br>

![](https://trello.com/1/cards/66b94dc5f84103ff5cd150cb/attachments/66b94e83fbf0a41083456b31/previews/66b94e84fbf0a41083456e3f/download/aloereadme.png) <br> <br> They spawn inside and target players based on their HP, so the lower it is the more interested she'll be in them. Once a player is caught by an Aloe, they'll be taken away and held captive in her favorite spot, where she'll nurse them back to health. <br>
After or before being fully healed, you may free yourself by mashing space bar; Be careful though, as they won't let you escape that easily! <br>
<br> The way you counter them is the same as the Bracken's, so watch your back and run away as fast as you can! 


</details> 

### [ Ogopogo ] - Earth Leviathan Variant

<details><summary> Spoilers </summary>
<br>
The Ogopogo are hostile entities which spawn in the water with similar behavioral patterns to Earth Leviathans.
<br>
<br>

![](https://trello.com/1/cards/66b9a4abe53bc4f6bd9e0eaa/attachments/66ba239d5a5a0ae820557997/download/ogoreadme.png) <br> <br> They spawn at the bottom of Vow, March, and Adamance's bodies of water, and never route outside of those. Any player spotted near their general area will be targeted and promptly dragged underwater where its young, the Vermin, will eat away at them.
<br> <br> The only way to effectively counter them is to run away as soon as you hear their warning signal or hold onto an active stun device while it's snatching you. </details>

### [ Boom birds and Coil-crabs ] - Manticoil Variant and Coil-head critter.

<details><summary> Spoilers </summary>
<br>
Though small and fraile, these little guys will surely spice up daytime gameplay. <br>

![](https://trello.com/1/cards/67eaedc3c1265b550abde772/attachments/67eaee6678daa377ec3212a6/download/boombirdcoilreadmeSmall.png)
<br> Boom birds are small but gluttonous little birds which roam around many of the moons found within the Thistle Nebula. They tend to travel alone and fend for themselves in the wilderness while they look for a place to scavenge for food. <br> 
Once they've settled somewhere, they will begin calling more of their own; that's when YOU come in. You must keep them away from the ship by any means necessary! The ever-so-useful bestiary should include some information about them, so read it carefully to learn how to counter them. <br>

One of their known weaknesses is that they're easily scared off by loud noises if in small groups, so try that! <br> <br> 

Now Coil-crabs are even less dangerous than Boom birds, as decades of mutations and long-term exposure to their Coil-shell's radiation have caused them to lose the capability to hurt anything with their claws. Poor little things have such a hard time feeding that they resort to eating leftovers from bigger predators off the floor... <br>

Careful... They're conductive!

</details>

### [ Vermin, Prototax and Leaf boys ] - Ogopogo sub-entity, and the critter variants

<details><summary> Spoilers </summary>
<br>
Vermin, Prototax and Leaf boys are some of Biodiversity's more simple entities. <br>

![](https://trello.com/1/cards/66ba42b997c2d06a884a4d1b/attachments/66ba42bf991651190a17bd4d/download/crittersreadme.png)
<br> Vermin are the spawn of the Ogopogo, and come out during floods or after their parent Ogo has dragged prey into their nest. <br> Try smacking em! <br> <br>
Prototax are four legged fungi creatures related (non-biologically) to Spore lizards. Just like spore lizards, they wander around and remain passive, though Prototax will release spore clouds only when damaged. <br> Their spores are toxic, so leave them be! <br> <br>
Leaf boys are small, leaf-like organisms that like to run around and have fun during the early hours of the day. <br> They're quite fearful, so watch yourself around them at night! They might attract unwanted attention.

# Known Issues - Whoops :3 <br>

There are some problems with our entities that we'll look into fixing in the future, like:
- Ogopogo is NOT supported on moons other than the ones in the default spawn rarity config. If you add spawn weights for moons not in the defaults or anywhere it's not made to be in, the enemy will not work as intended.
- The Prototax's spore spew has a number of issues regarding its visuals. The fog itself renders as a cube, and it stops expanding once it collides with things like ReverbTriggers.
- Leaf boys are non-killable, which can lead to Eyeless dogs getting stuck trying to kill them. This is something we'll attempt to adress on our next content update.
